## Hypervisor
The software layer that breaks the dependencies of an operating system on the underlying hardware and allows several virtual machines to share that hardware is called a a hypervisor.

Kernel-based Virtual Machine, or KVM, is one well-known hypervisor.

## Container
Containers are isolated user spaces for running application code. The user space is all the code that resides above the kernel, and it includes applications and their dependencies.

Containers are lightweight because they donâ€™t carry a full operating system.
They can be scheduled or integrated tightly with the underlying system.

The application code is packaged with all the dependencies it needs, and the engine that executes the container is responsible for making them available at runtime.

## Container images
An application and its dependencies are called an image, and a container is simply a running instance of an image.

By building software into container images, developers can package and ship an application without worrying about the system it will run on.

Docker is one way to build containers.
But Docker does not offer way to orchestrate those applications at scale like kubernetes does.

- Linux Process : Each linux process has its own virtual memory address space. Linux process can be rapidly created and destroyed.
- Linux Namespace : Containers use Linux namespace to control what an application can see, such as process ID numbers, directory trees, IP addresses etc.
- Linux cgroups : control what an application can use, such as maximum consumption of CPU time, memory, I/O bandwidth etc.

Container use union file systems to bundle everything needed into a neat package.

A container image is structured in layers, and the tool used to build the image reads instructions from a file called container manifest.
For Docker container image that is Dockerfile.

When launching a new container from an image, the container runtime adds a new writable layer on top of the underlying layers. All changes made to the running container, such as writing new files, modifying existing files, and deleting files, are written to this thin writable container layer. This layer is ephemeral, which means that when the container is deleted, the contents of this writable layer are lost.

Google maintains Artifact Registry at **pkg.dev** which contains public open source images.
It also provides place to store private images which are integrated with IAM.

## Kubernetes
open source platform for managing containerized workloads and services. It makes it easy to orchestrate many containers on many hosts, scale them as microservices, and easily deploy rollouts and roollbacks.

At the highest level, Kubernetes is a set of APIs that you can use to deploy containers on a set of nodes called a cluster.

The Kubernetes system is divided into a set of primary components
1. one that run as the control plane
2. other set of nodes that run containers

A node represents a computing instance, like a machine.

Kubernetes supports declarative configurations.

## Google Kubernetes Engine
GKE is managed kubernetes service hosted on Google's infrastructure. It's designed to help deploy, manage and scale Kuberbernetes services hosted on google's infrastructure.

Google Kubernetes Engine offers a mode of operation called GKE Autopilot, which is designed to manage your cluster configuration, like nodes, scaling, security, and other preconfigured settings.

The GKE auto-upgrade feature ensures that clusters are always upgraded with the latest stable version of Kubernetes.

The virtual machines that host containers in a GKE cluster are called nodes.

GKE has a node auto-repair feature that was designed to repair unhealthy nodes.

It performs periodic health checks on each node of the cluster and nodes determined to be unhealthy are drained and recreated.

Just like Kubernetes supports scaling workloads, GKE supports scaling the cluster itself.

GKE is integrated with several services: Cloud Build uses private container images securely stored in Artifact Registry to automate the deployment.

GKE is integrated with several services: 
- Cloud Build uses private container images securely stored in Artifact Registry to automate the deployment.
- IAM helps control access by using accounts and role permissions.
- Cloud Monitoring provides an understanding into how an application is performing.
- Virtual Private Clouds, which provide a network infrastructure including load balancers and ingress access for your cluster.
- Google Cloud console provides insights into GKE clusters and their resources, and a way to view, inspect, and delete resources in those clusters.
